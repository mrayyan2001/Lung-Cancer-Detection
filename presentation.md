- Affiliation: **[Your Name], [Your University/Department]** (Small font)
- Image: A powerful image representing lung cancer detection, possibly a CT scan with a highlighted nodule.

_Speaker Notes_
Good morning/afternoon/evening, esteemed committee members. Today, I'm thrilled to present my graduate project on utilizing deep learning for lung cancer detection. This project has the potential to significantly improve early diagnosis rates.

**Slide 2: Introduction**

- Title: **The Challenge of Lung Cancer**
- Bullet Points:
  - Briefly introduce lung cancer as a leading cause of cancer-related deaths.
  - Highlight the importance of early detection for improved patient outcomes.
- Image: A graph or chart illustrating lung cancer mortality rates.

_Speaker Notes_
Lung cancer remains a formidable challenge in healthcare. As you can see from this graph (Explain the graph and its significance), early detection is crucial for successful treatment.

**Slide 3: Deep Learning for Medical Image Analysis**

- Title: **Harnessing Deep Learning's Power**
- Bullet Points:
  - Introduce deep learning (DL) and its ability to learn complex patterns from data.
  - Explain how DL can be applied to medical image analysis for disease detection.
- Image: A simplified diagram illustrating the deep learning architecture (e.g., convolutional neural network).

_Speaker Notes_
Deep learning has emerged as a powerful tool for various tasks, including medical image analysis. Deep learning models can effectively learn intricate patterns from large datasets, making them well-suited for (Explain how DL is applicable to medical image analysis).

**Slide 4: Project Methodology**

- Title: **Dataset and Imbalance**
- Bullet Points:
  - Introduce the imbalanced "iq-OTH/NCCD lung cancer dataset" you used.
  - Explain the challenges associated with imbalanced datasets in classification tasks.
- Image: A visual representation of the dataset (if possible) or an image depicting imbalanced data.

_Speaker Notes_
For this project, I leveraged the "iq-OTH/NCCD lung cancer dataset." However, a critical challenge with this dataset is its imbalanced nature (Explain how the dataset is imbalanced). Imbalanced data can lead to models favoring the majority class, hindering accurate detection of the minority class (cancerous nodules).

**Slide 5: Addressing Imbalance and Model Selection**

- Title: **Balancing the Dataset and Choosing CNN**
- Bullet Points:
  - Explain the method you used to address class imbalance (e.g., oversampling, undersampling).
  - Justify your choice of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture for lung nodule classification.
- Image: A flowchart or diagram illustrating the data balancing technique.

_Speaker Notes_
To address the data imbalance, I employed (Specify the data balancing technique you used, e.g., oversampling). This technique helped ensure the model pays adequate attention to both cancerous and non-cancerous nodules. Given the task of nodule classification from images, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was a natural choice due to its (Explain why CNN is suitable for this task).

**Slide 6: Results and Performance**

- Title: **Highly Accurate Lung Cancer Detection**
- Bullet Points:
  - Emphasize the impressive accuracy of your CNN model (around 99%).
  - Briefly showcase how the model identifies cancerous nodules in lung scans (consider using visuals).
- Image:
  - A confusion matrix depicting model performance (true positives, true negatives, etc.).
  - A sample lung scan with a highlighted cancerous nodule identified by the model.

_Speaker Notes_
The results are very promising! The CNN model achieved a remarkable accuracy of around 99%. This indicates the model's exceptional ability to distinguish cancerous nodules from non-cancerous ones in lung scans. As you can see in this image (Explain the image, e.g., confusion matrix), the model performs well on both positive and negative classifications. (If applicable, show a lung scan with a highlighted nodule).

**Slide 7: Conclusion and Future Directions**

- Title: **The Potential Impact**

- Bullet Points:
  - Restate the significance of your project's findings for early lung cancer detection.
  - Briefly discuss the potential real-world impact on patient care and survival rates.
