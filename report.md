3. Dataset: [The IQ-OTH/NCCD lung cancer dataset](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/bhmdr45bh2/4) \
   The dataset contains a total of 1190 images representing CT scan slices of 110 cases. These cases are grouped into three classes: normal, benign, and malignant. of these, 40 cases are diagnosed as malignant; 15 cases diagnosed with benign; and 55 cases classified as normal cases.
4. We have used the following websites for visualizing the model: [Netron](https://netron.app/) and [NN-SVG](https://alexlenail.me/NN-SVG/AlexNet.html)
